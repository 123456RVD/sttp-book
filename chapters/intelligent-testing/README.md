# Intelligent testing
In this chapter we are going to work smarter rather than harder, and take a look at different testing techniques that perform software testing in an intelligent way.
When testing, having 100% code coverage does not mean you have tested your program 100%.

- First we will take a look at a technique called **random testing**, that will make use of random input to create test cases.

- After that we will discuss **mutation testing** and how you can check the quality of your test suite.

- The section on **fuzz testing** will show how you can test the correctness of a program by providing unexpected input.

- Finally, in **search-based testing** we will see how optimizing search techniques can help to automate testing.
