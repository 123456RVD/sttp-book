# Intelligent testing
In this chapter we are going to work smarter rather than harder, and take a look at different testing techniques that perform software testing in an intelligent way.
So far we have used automation only during test execution.
Our computers, however, can help a great deal in the test suite design and this is exactly what we are going to discuss in the following sections.

- First we will discuss **mutation testing** and how you can check the quality of your test suite.

- The section on **fuzz testing** will show how you can test the correctness of a program by providing unexpected input.

- Finally, in **search-based testing** we will see how optimizing search techniques can help to automate testing.
