Welcome to the lecture notes of TU Delft's CSE1110 Software Quality and Testing course.

This course covers the most important testing techniques needed to build high quality software systems. Specific topics covered are quality attributes, maintainability and testability, manual and exploratory testing, automated testing, devops, test adequacy, model-based testing, state-based testing, decision tables, reviews and inspections, design-by-contract, test-driven design, unit versus integration testing, mocks and stubs.

Our learning goals are:

* Participants are able to create unit, integration, and system tests using current existing tools (i.e., JUnit, Mockito, and JaCoCo) that successfully test complex software systems.

* Participants are able to derive test cases that deal with exceptional, corner, and bad weather cases by performing several different techniques (i.e., boundary analysis, state-based testing, decision tables).

* Participants are able to measure and reflect about the efficiency of the developed test suites by means of different test adequacy metrics (i.e., line, branch, condition, MC/DC coverage).

* Participants are able to reflect about limitations of current testing techniques, when and when not to apply them in a given context, and to design testable software systems.

* Participants are able to write maintainable test code by avoiding well-known test code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette, Slow or Obscure Tests).
